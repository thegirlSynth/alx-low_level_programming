# C - Functions, nested loops

In this project, I achieved the following learning objectives.
I understood:
* what nested loops are and how to use them.

* what a function is and how functions are used.

* the difference between the declaration and the definition of a function.

* what a prototype is

* scope of variables

* what the `gcc` flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-pedantic` `-Wextra` `-std=gnu89` represent

* what header files are and how to use them with `#include`

# Prototypes:

`void print_alphabet(void);`

`void print_alphabet_x10(void);`

# File Descriptions:
* `0-putchar.c` prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.

* `1-alphabet.c` prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
