# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This is a project that illustrates:
* What nested are loops and how to use them
* What a function is and how to use functions
* What the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function is

### Further Description

Script `0-isupper.c` checks for uppercase character. Returns 1 if c is uppercase, Returns 0 otherwise

Script `1-isdigit.c` checks for a digit (0 through 9). Returns 1 if c is a digit. Returns 0 otherwise

Script `2-mul.c` multiplies two integers.

Script `3-print_numbers.c` prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Script `4-print_most_numbers.c`  prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Script `5-more_numbers.c` prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

Script `6-print_line.c` draws a straight line in the terminal.

Script `7-print_diagonal.c` draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

Script `8-print_square.c` prints a square, followed by a new line.

Script `9-fizz_buzz.c`  prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

Script `10-print_triangle.c`  prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

Script `100-prime_factor.c` prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

Script `101-print_number.c` prints an integer.
