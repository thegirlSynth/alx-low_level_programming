0-main.c tests that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

1-main.c comments out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2-largest_number.c fixes the code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3-print_remaining_days.c fixes the  function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
